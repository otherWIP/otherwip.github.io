Installing emonHub to a RaspberryPi is really quite straight forward using the Debian Package Installer. To be able to locate the software your Pi needs to know the repository address and then you tell it to install, the installer asks you some questions and in many cases offers default values, once it has the info it needs it will prepare everything for you.
