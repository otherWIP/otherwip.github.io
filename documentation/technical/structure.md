emonHub structure
============

The emonHub system is specifically not designed to be run directly from a cloned git repository. 

This is a deliberate choice to ensure that the file structure and version control specifics are not tightly coupled to running installations, which makes refactoring without breaking these installations impractical.

Major structure changes are always being discussed. If you prefer to symlink or clone into /usr/share/emonhub/ that's up to you, but no guarantee is made that running `git pull` won't completely break your installation. See the various installation guides for a better way to get up and running with emonHub!

##What does what and where does it go?##

Version 1 proposed filesystem:

 - `conf/`
   - `conf/emonhub.conf` : configuration for emonhub itself
   - `conf/default/emonhub` : configuration for the init.d service script
 - `service/`
   - `service/emonhub` : init.d service script (controls the emonhub daemon)
 - `src/`
   - `emonhub.py` : the core emonhub source module. 
   - _other Python source files as required_

##Deployed filesystem##

Once installed, the following will be observed:

- `service/emonhub` is deployed as `/etc/init.d/emonhub`
- `conf/default/emonhub` is deployed as `/etc/default/emonhub`
- `src/*.py` is deployed as `/usr/share/emonhub/*.py`
- `conf/emonhub.conf` is deployed as `/etc/emonhub/emonhub.conf`

Using default config, emonhub will begin logging to `/var/log/emonhub/emonhub.log`

## Development tips ##

The simplest way to work with this structure on a development machine is to symlink the files from the repository onto the final destinations, for example by running `sudo ln -s /full/path/to/src /usr/share/emonhub` (which would mean your `src/` directory becomes "live", and once satisfied you can just do a `git commit` on the repository).

An alternative is to edit the various configuration parameters to point the daemon at your repository (i.e. by editing `EMONHUB_PATH` in `/etc/default/emonhub` to point to `/your/full/repo/path/src`)

Don't forget to reinstate to ensure all your changes work together, prior to pushing changes up for others to use.
