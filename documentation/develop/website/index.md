### EmonHub website

The emonHub website is hosted on GitHub Pages

Using GitHub pages to host the documentation website is an attempt to ease the task of documentation. Content is written almost entirely in markdown and the documents are then parsed directly to html pages automatically.

This method means that developers and users can contribute directly to the website using normal github procedures and has the intention of optimizing support as changes and solutions can be documented and updated more frequently than running a separate website.
