EmonHub support
---------------------

Since emonHub is open-source software developed by enthusiasts on a voluntary basis there is no "official" support as such, but as part of the OpenEnergyMonitor project the main source of support is the OEM forum.

It is the intention of this site to try and document the information to assist in the more common tasks such as installing emonHub and is in no way complete as development is currently active and emonHub constantly evolving.

The OEM project is well established and has a very knowledgeable and helpful community, the forum is a fantastic source of information and using the sites search facility is highly recommended before posting.
