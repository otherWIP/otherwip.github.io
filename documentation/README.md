This folder contains all the sites pages, there are 3 types of page in this folder

1) README.md - these do not get published and can only be seen via the repo. used for notes, todo's, links work in progress etc

2) index.md - these web pages are found using the folder name in the url (if published true is set)

3) *page*.md - these pages have the url of the folder plus the *page* name (no ext)

type 3) pages can become type 2) just by renaming, add "/index" between current name and .md, there by creating a sub-folder by the same name and an index.md, to this a README.md can be added, plus other pages and sub-folders.
