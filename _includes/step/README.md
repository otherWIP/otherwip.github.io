{{ include step/*step-name* }}
-------------------------------
Steps are intended to be reusable chunks of text, worded and formatted to be included in multiple instuction pages.



As a step grows it can become a page by creating a md that contains just that include and/or can be reduced in size by having chunks removed and replaced with an include to the removed text in a new smaller include if required.
