{{ include step/*step-name* }}
-------------------------------
Steps are intended to be reusable chunks of text, worded and formatted to be included in multiple instuction pages.



As a step grows it can become a page by creating a md that contains just that include and/or can be reduced in size by having chunks removed and replaced with an include to the removed text in a new smaller include if required.

includes generally start with a #### to give them a heading if a step is upgraded to a page it is best to start with a ## and when that step is used in a chain of steps the include code can be prefixed ## as these hashes will be prepended to the existing ## resulting in the original ####

the "add-repo" step has a "dist" parameter so can be called for wheezy or quantal etc

    {{ include step/add-repo dist="wheezy" }}

the "add-pack" step has a "pack" parameter so can be called to install emonhub or emoncms or both

    {{ include step/add-pack pack="emonhub emoncms event-module-emoncms" }}
